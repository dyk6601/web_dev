# hw  Rhizome's Net Art Anthology

Telepresence 2 by Corpos Inform√°ticos is an online artwork that explores the connection between bodies and technology. It plays with the idea of being present in a digital space while physically being somewhere else. The project uses interactive elements to show how technology can change the way we experience movement, identity, and communication. By blending the physical and virtual worlds, Telepresence 2 challenges what it means to truly "be" somewhere in the digital age.

This reminded me of the COVID lockdown where zoom calls are the only way to communicate with others outside of your family. Instead of actually being with them changed the dynamic of what I can do with my friends and it reshaped the way I approached facetime calls. Since then it doesnt feel weird for me to go on calls for hours just kind of talking to them, being in presence while doing my own work for hours. To be really present and be somewhere has changed for me through technology.
